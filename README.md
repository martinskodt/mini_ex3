### Describe a bit about your throbber design (your concept and execution)
I have made a drawing spiral throbber. I liked the idea of something starting from the middle and taking over the canvas. But eventually it formed into the circle because of the spiral shape. I made a spin using sinus and cosinus og the x and y axis. Then just messed with colors, variables, speed, ocapacity and size until i was satisfied. 
### How may we use programming to reflect and inquire digital (visual) culture?
