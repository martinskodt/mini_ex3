### Describe a bit about your throbber design (your concept and execution)
I have made a drawing spiral throbber. I liked the idea of something starting from the middle and taking over the canvas. But eventually it formed into the circle because of the spiral shape. I made a spin using sinus and cosinus og the x and y axis. Then just messed with colors, variables, speed, ocapacity and size until i was satisfied. 
### How may we use programming to reflect and inquire digital (visual) culture?
We can use programming as a form of expression. When we program we make constant choises. These choises has designlike qualities, in their functionallity and in how they reflect the context of the code. We can use programming to design visuals that follow the standard og challenges our expectation. Like with a throbber. We expect it to be round and moving in some form. Because our conceptuel idea of a throbber is connected to streaming. So symbolicly speaking we see the roundlike endless motion, in the throbber, as an testement to the stream as a media and its function. 
This we can question and reflect uppon these standards through programming. Make our own, copy and change others or insert them in unexpected places.
